#Ugly Numbers

A number with prime factor only in  {2,3,5} is called an ugly number.  Write a function, `isUgly(n)` that tests that a number is ugly.

Now find the nth ugly number. Try to do this first in n^2 time, `nthUglyNumber` then in linear time, `nthUglyNumberLinear`.  This requires a trick, you cannot just try every number. 


Generalize this to a list of prime numbers, `superUglyNumber(n, primes)`.
